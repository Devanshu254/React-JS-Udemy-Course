### The code you write isn't exactly what the browser runs. It gets changed a bit before the browser uses it.

### Why React Uses a Build Process:
1. The original React code you write won't work directly in a browser because JSX (a mix of HTML and JavaScript) isn't standard JavaScript.
2. Also, the original code isn't optimized for production. For example, itâ€™s not minified. Minifying means making variable and function names shorter to reduce the amount of JavaScript code sent to the user.
