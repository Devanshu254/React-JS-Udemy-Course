# React Vs Vanilla JavaScript.

### If we will write react.new in our incognito window or normal window, a new react project will be opened up for us by a website called CodeSandBox.

* The Reason We use React is It it Declarative. That is you provide define the target means state but not the steps to go there, react will figure it out and then perform necessary steps.
* React Is simple.
* Within Less Number of Lines Of Codes we can provide more functionality.

* Vanilla JavaScript is imparitive. Means we define the steps not the goal.
* Vanilla JavaScript is tough.
* We need to write lot of code in order to provide some features and functionality.

## Steps to create a react application in local machine.
* npm create vite@latest
* Choose react and then choose JavaScript.
* npm install -> For installing dependencies.
* npm run dev -> For running the application within an development environment.

Note: React code does not run in the browser. React code typically uses JSX. That is why more complex setup is needed to run react.
